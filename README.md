# OpenICE

OpenICE is an independent data transparency project tracking U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detention statistics. The project is developed by [AI Escape](https://aiescape.io) and is not affiliated with or endorsed by any government agency. All data is sourced from publicly available ICE reports and may not reflect the most current information.

## Repository Overview

This repository contains three main parts:

| Directory | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| [`backend/`](backend/) | FastAPI service that ingests Excel reports and exposes a JSON API. Contains Docker configuration and scripts for data import. |
| [`frontend/`](frontend/) | React application built with Yarn and Tailwind CSS for visualizing detention statistics. |
| [`infrastructure/`](infrastructure/) | AWS CDK project that defines the infrastructure to host the API and website. |

Each subdirectory provides its own `README.md` with detailed setup instructions.

## Quick Start

1. Clone the repository

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AI-Escape/open-ice.git
   cd open-ice
   ```

2. Follow the setup guides in the [`backend`](backend/README.md) and [`frontend`](frontend/README.md) folders to run the API and web application locally. Docker and Node.js are required.

3. Infrastructure deployment uses the AWS CDK. See [`infrastructure/README.md`](infrastructure/README.md) for commands to synthesize and deploy.
